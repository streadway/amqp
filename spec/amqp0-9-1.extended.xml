    in your possession or control.

    As used hereunder, "Licensed Claims" means those claims of a patent or
    patent application, throughout the world, excluding design patents and
    design registrations, owned or controlled, or that can be sublicensed
    without fee and in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement,
    by an Author or its affiliates now or at any future time and which would
    necessarily be infringed by implementation of the Advanced Messaging
    Queue Protocol Specification. A claim is necessarily infringed hereunder
    only when it is not possible to avoid infringing it because there is no
    plausible non-infringing alternative for implementing the required
    portions of the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensed Claims shall not include any
    claims other than as set forth above even if contained in the same patent
    as Licensed Claims; or that read solely on any implementations of any
    portion of the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification that are
    not required by the Advanced Messaging Queue ProtocolSpecification, or
    that, if licensed, would require a payment of royalties by the licensor
    to unaffiliated third parties. Moreover, Licensed Claims shall not
    include (i) any enabling technologies that may be necessary to make or
    use any Licensed Product but are not themselves expressly set forth in
    the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification (e.g., semiconductor
    manufacturing technology, compiler technology, object oriented
    technology, networking technology, operating system technology, and the
    like); or (ii) the implementation of other published standards developed
    elsewhere and merely referred to in the body of the Advanced Messaging
    Queue Protocol Specification, or (iii) any Licensed Product and any
    combinations thereof the purpose or function of which is not required
    for compliance with the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification.
    For purposes of this definition, the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol
    Specification shall be deemed to include both architectural and
    interconnection requirements essential for interoperability and may also
    include supporting source code artifacts where such architectural,
    interconnection requirements and source code artifacts are expressly
    identified as being required or documentation to achieve compliance with
    the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification.

    As used hereunder, "Licensed Products" means only those specific portions
    of products (hardware, software or combinations thereof) that implement
    and are compliant with all relevant portions of the Advanced Messaging
    Queue Protocol Specification.

<!-- XML Notes

    We use entities to indicate repetition; attributes to indicate properties.

    We use the 'name' attribute as an identifier, usually within the context
    of the surrounding entities.

    We use spaces to seperate words in names, so that we can print names in
    their natural form depending on the context - underlines for source code,
    hyphens for written text, etc.

    We do not enforce any particular validation mechanism but we support all
    mechanisms.  The protocol definition conforms to a formal grammar that is
    published seperately in several technologies.

  </domain>

  <domain name = "delivery-tag" type = "longlong" label = "server-assigned delivery tag">
    <doc>
      The server-assigned and channel-specific delivery tag
    </doc>
    <rule name = "channel-local">
      <doc>
        The delivery tag is valid only within the channel from which the message was
        received. I.e. a client MUST NOT receive a message on one channel and then
        acknowledge it on another.
      </doc>
    </rule>
    <rule name = "non-zero">
      <doc>
        The server MUST NOT use a zero value for delivery tags. Zero is reserved
        for client use, meaning "all messages so far received".
      </doc>
    </rule>
  </domain>

  <domain name = "exchange-name" type = "shortstr" label = "exchange name">
    <doc>
      The exchange name is a client-selected string that identifies the exchange for
      publish methods.

  </domain>

  <domain name = "method-id" type = "short" />

  <domain name = "no-ack" type = "bit" label = "no acknowledgement needed">
    <doc>
      If this field is set the server does not expect acknowledgements for
      messages. That is, when a message is delivered to the client the server
      assumes the delivery will succeed and immediately dequeues it. This
      functionality may increase performance but at the cost of reliability.
      Messages can get lost if a client dies before they are delivered to the
      application.
    </doc>
  </domain>

  <domain name = "no-local" type = "bit" label = "do not deliver own messages">
    <doc>
      If the no-local field is set the server will not send messages to the connection that
      published them.
    </doc>
  </domain>

  <domain name = "no-wait" type = "bit" label = "do not send reply method">
    <doc>
      If set, the server will not respond to the method. The client should not wait
      for a reply method. If the server could not complete the method it will raise a
      channel or connection exception.

  </domain>

  <domain name = "queue-name" type = "shortstr" label = "queue name">
    <doc>
      The queue name identifies the queue within the vhost.  In methods where the queue
      name may be blank, and that has no specific significance, this refers to the
      'current' queue for the channel, meaning the last queue that the client declared
      on the channel.  If the client did not declare a queue, and the method needs a
      queue name, this will result in a 502 (syntax error) channel exception.
    </doc>

      This indicates that the message has been previously delivered to this or
      another client.
    </doc>
    <rule name = "implementation">
      <doc>
        The server SHOULD try to signal redelivered messages when it can. When

        Declare a shared queue and publish a message to the queue.  Consume the
        message using explicit acknowledgements, but do not acknowledge the
        message.  Close the connection, reconnect, and consume from the queue
        again.  The message should arrive with the redelivered flag set.
      </doc>
    </rule>
    <rule name = "hinting">
      <doc>
        The client MUST NOT rely on the redelivered field but should take it as a
        hint that the message may already have been processed. A fully robust
        client must be able to track duplicate received messages on non-transacted,
        and locally-transacted channels.

    </rule>
  </domain>

  <domain name = "message-count" type = "long" label = "number of messages in queue">
    <doc>
      The number of messages in the queue, which will be zero for newly-declared
      queues. This is the number of messages present in the queue, and committed

        This method allows a client to reject one or more incoming messages. It can be

        messages to their original queue.

        This method is also used by the server to inform publishers on channels in
        confirm mode of unhandled messages.  If a publisher receives this method, it

      Servers SHOULD implement atomic transactions at least where all publish

      The Confirm class allows publishers to put the channel in
      confirm mode and susequently be notified when messages have been
      handled by the broker.  The intention is that all messages
      published on a channel in confirm mode will be acknowledged at
      some point.  By acknowledging a message the broker assumes
      responsibility for it and indicates that it has done something
      it deems reasonable with it.

      Unroutable mandatory or immediate messages are acknowledged
      right after the Basic.Return method. Messages are acknowledged
      when all queues to which the message has been routed
      have either delivered the message and received an
      acknowledgement (if required), or enqueued the message (and
      persisted it if required).

      Published messages are assigned ascending sequence numbers,
      starting at 1 with the first Confirm.Select method. The server
      confirms messages by sending Basic.Ack methods referring to these
      sequence numbers.
